# ðŸ“¦ Dependency Updates for Production

## ðŸ”§ Optional Package Updates

These warnings appeared during deployment. The app works fine, but for production you might want to update:

```bash
# Update deprecated packages
npm update supertest@latest
npm update multer@latest  
npm update glob@latest
npm update superagent@latest

# Remove deprecated packages
npm uninstall inflight
npm uninstall google-p12-pem

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

## ðŸ“‹ Priority Levels

**High Priority:**
- `multer` (security vulnerabilities)
- `supertest` (if using in production tests)

**Medium Priority:**
- `glob`, `superagent` (performance improvements)

**Low Priority:**
- `inflight`, `google-p12-pem` (cleanup)

## ðŸ§ª Testing After Updates

After updating dependencies:
```bash
npm test
npm start
# Test all endpoints
```

**Note:** These updates are optional for current deployment. Your app is working fine with current dependencies.
